# Todolist-Website

This is a simple TodoList website made by me where you can add/delete cards and in each of those add/delete tasks, this also uses the local storage of your browser and saves all of your tasks there and retrieves them when you open it the next time.

Check out the website here : https://todolist000.netlify.app/
